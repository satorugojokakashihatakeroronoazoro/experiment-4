WHY DOES WATER BOIL IF AIR PRESSURE IS DECREASED

Water boils when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding air pressure. At sea level, air pressure is high, so water boils at 100°C. But if air pressure is decreased—like at high altitudes or in a vacuum chamber—water doesn’t need to be as hot to boil. This is because there’s less pressure holding the water molecules down, so they escape as gas more easily. That’s why water can even boil at room temperature in low pressure
